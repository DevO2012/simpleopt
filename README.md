# simpleopt
Cross-platform C++ library for command-line parsing and file globbing.


A cross-platform command line library which can parse almost any of the standard command line formats in use today.
It supports character types of ASCII, MBCS and Unicode.
It is designed explicitly to be portable to any platform and has been tested on Windows and Linux. 
It also includes a cross-platform implementation of glob() so that wildcards in command line arguments are simply expanded for use by the program. 
Released as open-source and free using the MIT licence.
